export const HERO_CONTENT = `As a recent graduate stepping into web development, I’ve built a solid foundation through hands-on projects and guidance from mentors. I’m passionate about front-end development and have experience with React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I take pride in my ability to turn Figma designs into pixel-perfect web pages, ensuring that everything matches the design exactly. I’ve also worked with various RESTful APIs, like those from Shopify and Java-based services, which has helped me connect front-end features with back-end systems. My experience with MongoDB is still growing, but I’ve worked with it to manage and integrate data for dynamic applications. Overall, these experiences have given me a strong start in web development and have fueled my excitement to continue learning and growing in the field.  `;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Looking ahead, I’m excited about the opportunity to grow further in a professional setting, especially with the support of experienced colleagues. I’m eager to expand my skills beyond front-end development and gain a deeper understanding of back-end technologies. I’m particularly interested in learning more about how to integrate various technologies to build complete and efficient web applications. I’m also keen to explore new tools and methodologies that can enhance my development process and overall project outcomes. By contributing to innovative projects and learning from skilled developers, I aim to enhance my technical abilities and become a more well-rounded developer. I’m enthusiastic about taking on new challenges and making valuable contributions to the team’s success, while continuously pushing myself to improve and stay updated with industry trends.`;
